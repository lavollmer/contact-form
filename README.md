## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this contact form and make it look as close to the design as possible. Pay particular attention to making this form accessible. Building accessible forms is a key skill for front-end developers, so this is a perfect challenge to practice.

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

This project began with the initial setup, which included creating a GitHub repository, initializing a Vite project with ReactJS, and integrating TailwindCSS. I configured TailwindCSS to incorporate the project's design specifications, such as fonts and colors. After ensuring the basic elements were operational through an initial commit, I proceeded to remove the default ReactJS template content to start with a clean slate.


## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Fonts
- Tailwind CSS Animation
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

Here are several things I learned throughout this project:

1. **_App.css Classes_** - I wanted an easy approach to designing the background of this application. I decided to do CSS in App.css and import it into App.jsx. This allowed me to cover the whole width and height of the screen with the light green color and format appropriately. I made a few mistakes such as wv (width view) should actually be vw(view width), etc.
2. **_App.css Classes_**
